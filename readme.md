## histograms.py

There are two programs involved with this application. The first `histgrams.py` generates the histograms from the images and outputs a text file containing the histograms on each line. You do not need to run `histgrams.py` unless you want to change the images tested. The lines are prepended with whether or not the image contains an aurora (for validation and testing). The `output_stretch.txt` file is already generated and you do not need to run `histgrams.py` again. If you want to change the images tested, put them into the respective folders in the `training_images` directory.

## perceptron.py

This is the main program of this application. To run simply type `py perceptron.py`.
